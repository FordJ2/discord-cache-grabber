# Discord cache grabber
An easy way to see all current and deleted profile picturres and photos.

*All* files seen in your Discord gui are saved in `%appdata%\discord\cache` as unviewable files.
The `.bat` script makes everything viewable in a `.png` format. By removing some of the comments, it can be automated to refresh the directory every `N` seconds.
