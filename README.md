# Discord-cache-grabber
An easy way to see all current and deleted pictures, videos and profile pictures

All discord files, deleted or not, are saved in `%appdata%\discord\cache` however are saved as `.file`, making them completely unviewable.
Changing the file extention by hand of however many thousands of files, (a) doesnt work without command promt, and (b) can be a pain in the butt.

This short `.bat` file converts all those images into `.png`, as well as open up your file explorer browser right into the directory.
